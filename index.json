This documentation has been built using Fornax.\n\n## Installation\n\nFornax is released as a global .NET Core tool. You can install it with `dotnet tool install fornax -g`\n\n## CLI Application\n\nThe main functionality of Fornax comes from CLI applications that lets user scaffold, and generate webpages.\n\n* `fornax new` - scaffolds new blog in current working directory using really simple template\n* `fornax build` - builds webpage, puts output to `_public` folder\n* `fornax watch` - starts a small webserver that hosts your generated site, and a background process that recompiles the site whenever any changes are detected. This is the recommended way of working with Fornax.\n* `fornax clean` - removes output directory and any temp files\n* `fornax version` - prints out the currently-installed version of Fornax\n* `fornax help` - prints out help\n\n## Getting started\n\nEasiest way to get started with `fornax` is running `fornax new` and than `fornax watch` - this will create fairly minimal blog site template, start `fornax` in watch mode and start webserver. Then you can go to the `localhost:8080` in your browser to see the page, and edit the scaffolded files in editor to make changes.\nAdditionally, you can take a look at `samples` folder in this repository - it have couple more `loaders` and `generators` that you can potentially use in your website.\n\n## Website definition\n\nFornax is using normal F# code (F# script files) to define any of it's core concepts: `loaders`, `generators` and `config`.\n\n### SiteContents\n\n`SiteContents` is fairly simple type that provides access to any information available to the Fornax. The information is put into it by using `loaders` and then can be accessed in the `generators`.\n\n`SiteContents` has several functions in it's public API:\n\n```fsharp\ntype A = {a: string}\ntype B = {b: int; c: int}\n\nlet sc = SiteContents()\nsc.Add({a = \"test\"})\nsc.Add({a = \"test2\"})\nsc.Add({a = \"test3\"})\n\nsc.Add({b = 1; c = 3}) //You can add objects of different types, `Add` method is generic.\n\nlet as = sc.TryGetValues<A>() //This will return option of sequence of all added elements for given type - in this case it will be 3 elements\nlet b = sc.TryGetValue<B>() //This will return option of element for given type\n```\n\n### Loaders\n\n`Loader` is an F# script responsible for loading external data into generation context. The data typically includes things like content of `.md` files, some global site configuration, etc. But since those are normal F# functions, you can do whatever you need.\nWant to load information from local database, or from internet? Sure, why not. Want to use World Bank TP to include some of the World Bank statistics? That's also possible - you can use in `loader` any dependency as in normal F# script.\n\n`Loaders` are normal F# functions that takes as an input `SiteContents` and absolute path to the page root, and returns `SiteContents`:\n\n```fsharp\n#r \"../_lib/Fornax.Core.dll\"\n\ntype Page = {\n    title: string\n    link: string\n}\n\nlet loader (projectRoot: string) (siteContent: SiteContents) =\n    siteContent.Add({title = \"Home\"; link = \"/\"})\n    siteContent.Add({title = \"About\"; link = \"/about.html\"})\n    siteContent.Add({title = \"Contact\"; link = \"/contact.html\"})\n\n    siteContent\n```\n\n**Important note**: You can (and probably should) define multiple loaders - they will all be executed before generation of site, and will propagate information into `SiteContents`\n\n### Generators\n\n`Generator` is an F# script responsible for generating output of the Fornax process. This is usually `.html` file, but can be anything else - actually `generator` API just requires to return `string` that will be saved to file. Generators are, again, plain F# functions that as an input takes `SiteContents`, absolute path to the page root, relative path to the file that's currently processed (may be empty for the global generators) and returns `string`:\n\n```fsharp\n#r \"../_lib/Fornax.Core.dll\"\n#if !FORNAX\n#load \"../loaders/postloader.fsx\"\n#endif\n\nopen Html\n\nlet generate' (ctx : SiteContents) (_: string) =\n    let posts = ctx.TryGetValues<Postloader.Post> () |> Option.defaultValue Seq.empty\n\n    let psts =\n        posts\n        |> Seq.toList\n        |> List.map (fun p -> span [] [!! p.link] )\n\n    html [] [\n        div [] psts\n    ]\n\nlet generate (ctx : SiteContents) (projectRoot: string) (page: string) =\n    generate' ctx page\n    |> HtmlElement.ToString\n```\n\n**Important note**: You can (and probably should) define multiple generators - they will generate different kinds of pages and/or content, such as `post`, `index`, `about`, `rss` etc.\n\n### Configuration\n\n`Configuration` is a F# script file that defines when which analyzers need to be run, and how to save its output. `Config.fsx` file needs to be put in the root of your site project (the place from which you run `fornax` CLI tool)\n\n```fsharp\n#r \"../_lib/Fornax.Core.dll\"\n\nopen Config\nopen System.IO\n\nlet postPredicate (projectRoot: string, page: string) =\n    let fileName = Path.Combine(projectRoot,page)\n    let ext = Path.GetExtension page\n    if ext = \".md\" then\n        let ctn = File.ReadAllText fileName\n        ctn.Contains(\"layout: post\")\n    else\n        false\n\nlet staticPredicate (projectRoot: string, page: string) =\n    let ext = Path.GetExtension page\n    if page.Contains \"_public\" ||\n       page.Contains \"_bin\" ||\n       page.Contains \"_lib\" ||\n       page.Contains \"_data\" ||\n       page.Contains \"_settings\" ||\n       page.Contains \"_config.yml\" ||\n       page.Contains \".sass-cache\" ||\n       page.Contains \".git\" ||\n       page.Contains \".ionide\" ||\n       ext = \".fsx\"\n    then\n        false\n    else\n        true\n\nlet config = {\n    Generators = [\n        {Script = \"less.fsx\"; Trigger = OnFileExt \".less\"; OutputFile = ChangeExtension \"css\" }\n        {Script = \"sass.fsx\"; Trigger = OnFileExt \".scss\"; OutputFile = ChangeExtension \"css\" }\n        {Script = \"post.fsx\"; Trigger = OnFilePredicate postPredicate; OutputFile = ChangeExtension \"html\" }\n        {Script = \"staticfile.fsx\"; Trigger = OnFilePredicate staticPredicate; OutputFile = SameFileName }\n        {Script = \"index.fsx\"; Trigger = Once; OutputFile = NewFileName \"index.html\" }\n\n    ]\n}\n\n```"},{"uri":"/Editors/editorsOverview.html","title":"Editors overview","content":"\n# Editors overview\n\nOne of the main goals of the Ionide initiative is providing rich, cross-platform, open-source IDEs for F#."},{"uri":"/Editors/index.html","title":"Index","content":""},{"uri":"/Libraries/waypoint.html","title":"Waypoint","content":"\n# Waypoint\n\n**GitHub link:** [https://github.com/ionide/Waypoint](https://github.com/ionide/Waypoint)\n**License:** [MIT](https://github.com/ionide/Waypoint/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n\nOpinionated solution template for building F# OSS libraries and tools.\n\nSample repository is available here - https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/SampleWaypoint\n\nSample generated documentation can be found here - http://kcieslak.io/SampleWaypoint\n\n## What's included in template\n\n* Paket, FAKE, and Fornax added as `dotnet` local tools (`.config/dotnet-tools.json`)\n* `build.fsx` file, containing default FAKE script with targets for building, testing, documentation generation, publishing to GitHub, and publishing to NuGet\n* `paket.dependencies` with basic set of dependencies\n* `src` folder containing 2 projects - one class library (`netstandard2.0`), and CLI tool (`netcoreapp3.1`)\n* `test` folder containing UnitTest project using Expecto and FsCheck\n* `docs` folder with Fornax documentation template that will generate nice documentation for your project.\n* `.devcontainer` folder with definition of [Development Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)\n* `.github/workflows` folder with definition for 2 GitHub actions - one for building and testing code as CI, one for deploying documentation when new tag is pushed. To use latter, you need to define `PERSONAL_TOKEN` secret in GitHub repo settings with Personal Access Token.\n* `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder with 2 different issue templates - one for bug report, other one for feature request\n\n## Documentation Theme\n\nTemplate includes, out-of-the-box, nice theme for your project documentation, which integrates with FSharp.Formatting to create also API reference\n\n* Sample documentation produced by the template can be found on http://kcieslak.io/SampleWaypoint.\n* Created theme is partial port to Fornax of [Hugo Learn theme](https://learn.netlify.com/en/).\n* You define content as markdown files\n* Support for unlimited multi-level navigation\n* Use FSharp.Formatting to create API reference for the project - sample: http://kcieslak.io/SampleWaypoint/Reference/ApiRef.html\n* Use [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) to provide client side search based on generated by Fornax search index - sample: try searching for `Lorem` or `Sample` in search available on http://kcieslak.io/SampleWaypoint\n* Use [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) to provide client side render diagrams and graphs - sample: http://kcieslak.io/SampleWaypoint/diagrams.html\n\n## How to use template\n\n1. Install `dotnet new` template with `dotnet new -i Waypoint`\n2. Create new folder `mkdir TestApp` and go into it `cd TestApp`\n3. Create new project with `dotnet new Waypoint`\n\n## Motivation\n\nWaypoint got created for couple of reasons. Mostly because I (Chris) was unhappy with possible options \"on the market\" - don't get me wrong, I think projects like MiniScaffold are doing great job, but it was just not hitting my personal sweet spot for what I wanted from project scaffold.\nSecondly I strongly believe into having opinionated set of tools working well together, providing great Developer Experience - building such tools is something I've been doing for last couple of years, so providing single \"package\" seems like a logical next step.\nThirdly, I want Waypoint to be \"canonical\" example of using Fornax for documentation generation - scaffolded template contains really nice theme for documentation, integration with FSharp.Formatting, built-in search support, and more.\n\n\n## Inspired by\n\nNo project lives in vacuum - good ideas are very often just small improvements on the previous state of art. Waypoint has been heavily inspired by:\n\n* [fsprojects/ProjectScaffold](https://github.com/fsprojects/ProjectScaffold) - original F# OSS project template used by countless projects in F# ecosystem\n* [TheAngryByrd/MiniScaffold](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/MiniScaffold) - great project scaffold created by @TheAngryByrd, having many different options and functionalities\n* [SAFE-Stack/SAFE-template](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack/SAFE-template) - SAFE Stack template by @theimowski\n\n## Used projects\n\n* [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - modern, OSS, cross platform distribution of .NET; `dotnet` - CLI tool for developers\n* [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) - Paket is a dependency manager for .NET projects, popular in F# community.\n* [FAKE](https://fake.build/) - F# build DSL and task runner\n* [Fornax](https://ionide.io/Tools/fornax.html) - scriptable static site generator using type safe F# DSL to define page layouts\n* [Expecto](https://github.com/haf/expecto) - F# test library\n* [FsCheck](https://github.com/fscheck/FsCheck) - Random testing library for F#\n\n## FAQ\n\n1. What about `fsprojects/ProjectScaffold` ?\n\nProjectScaffold is fairly outdated template, and I think everyone, including original creators of ProjectScaffold will welcome modern alternative.\n\n2. What about `TheAngryByrd/MiniScaffold` ?\n\nMiniScaffold is great project, with many options and functionalities - such as code formatting, test coverage, sourcelinks and more. I've decided to create a scaffold feeding my needs and needs of Ionide projects that's bit more opinionated, and provide less functionalities. Please use whichever scaffold you want!\n\n3. Why do we even need solution scaffold? Is `dotnet new console` and `dotnet build` not enough?\n\nNo, it's not enough. Real world project, unlike conference demos, requires more structure, testing, documentation - especially OSS projects, if you care for adaption and user happiness. Beacuse of that we need something that will provide nice experience for both users and developers of the OSS projects.\n"},{"uri":"/Libraries/fsanalyzers.html","title":"FSharp.Analyzers.SDK","content":"\n# FSharp.Analyzers.SDK\n\n**GitHub link:** [https://github.com/ionide/FSharp.Analyzers.SDK](https://github.com/ionide/FSharp.Analyzers.SDK)  \n**License:** [MIT](https://github.com/ionide/FSharp.Analyzers.SDK/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n\n`FSharp.Analyzers.SDK` is a library used for building custom analyzers for FSAC / F# editors.

Long story short, it's an attempt at suggesting replacements for  unknown functions using type inference, as well as finding other entities that have matching type signatures.\n\n- Read more about `type holes`: [https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.10.1/docs/html/users_guide/typed-holes.html](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.10.1/docs/html/users_guide/typed-holes.html)\n- Read more about `type-directed search` in PureScript: [https://github.com/paf31/24-days-of-purescript-2016/blob/master/23.markdown](https://github.com/paf31/24-days-of-purescript-2016/blob/master/23.markdown)\n- Read more about `valid hole fits` in GHC: [https://mpg.is/papers/gissurarson2018suggesting.pdf](https://mpg.is/papers/gissurarson2018suggesting.pdf)\n\nUnlike some of the solutions for other FP languages, this is not a feature implemented directly in compiler, nor is it a feature of any particular IDE; rather it's using F# Analyzers.\n\nRead more about F# Analyzers:\n  - Intro blog post - [https://medium.com/lambda-factory/introducing-f-analyzers-772487889429](https://medium.com/lambda-factory/introducing-f-analyzers-772487889429)\n  - FSharp.Analyzers.SDK repo - [https://github.com/ionide/FSharp.Analyzers.SDK](https://github.com/ionide/FSharp.Analyzers.SDK)\n  - Sample analyzer implementation - [https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/FSharp.Analyzers.Sample](https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/FSharp.Analyzers.Sample)\n  - Sample repo showing how to use analyzers - [https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/AnalyzersShowcase](https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/AnalyzersShowcase)\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/EventHorizon.png\" />\n\n## Limitations\n\nF# Compiler Service does not expose any API for `subsumption of types`. I've implemented a really naive algorithm to check if an entity can fit a given type hole... but well, it's definitely not following the rules of the F# compiler 100%, so not every suggestion is found.\n\nI think that this limitation is acceptable given that the project is in an experimental phase - if it were productized, we would need to expose those missing APIs from F# Compiler Services, so investing more into a custom algorithm here would be a waste of time.\n"},{"uri":"/Editors/Code/getting_started.html","title":"Getting started","content":"\n# Getting started\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Visual Studio Code - it is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux created by Microsoft. For detailed documentation of editor, getting-started guides and more visit [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).\n\n* F# - it is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language. It empowers users and organizations to tackle complex computing problems with simple, maintainable and robust code. Ionide supports F# version 6.0. Detailed installation instructions can be found of F# Software foundation webpage - for [Windows](http://fsharp.org/use/windows/), [MacOS](http://fsharp.org/use/mac/), and [Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux/)\n\n* .NET SDK - .NET is lightweight, cross platform, modern implementation of .NET Framework. We strongly recommend installing it since some advanced Ionide features such as debugging and project scaffolding depends on SDK and `dotnet` CLI tooling even if your application is targetting Full Framework. For detailed instructions on installing .NET visit [official step-by-step installation guide](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)\n\n* VSCode C# plugin (optional) - Ionide's debugging capabilities relies on the debugger provided by Omnisharp team. To get it install [C# extension from VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)\n\n* MsBuild 2022 (Windows only, optional) - For old, verbose `.fsproj` files on Windows MsBuild 2022 (17.0) needs to be additionally installed. You can find it in the Tools for Visual Studio 2022 section [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or install Visual Studio 2022 itself. However, we highly recommend using new, SDK-based project files.\n\n## Plugin installation\n\nAny VSCode extension can be installed using UI just inside VSCode. Bring up the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code or the `View: Extensions` command (`Ctrl+Shift+X`). Then in search box type `Ionide` to find all 3 extensions we provide. Click the `Install` button and after a successful install, you'll see an `Reload` button which will prompt you to restart VS Code to enable the new extension. For more detailed information about plugin installation visit [VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)\n\n## Plugin activation\n\nVSCode plugins are running in external processes (which means they should never impact editor performance) and are activated lazily, when certain activation events happens. This means that plugins are not loaded unnecesserly, for example when you don't work on project using given programming language.\n\nIonide plugins are activated when:\n\n* Opened workspace contains any `.fsproj`, `.fs`, or `.fsx` file\n\n* New `.fsproj`, `.fs`, or `.fsx` file is created in workspace that was not containing those files before.\n"},{"uri":"/Editors/Code/overview.html","title":"Overview","content":"\n# Ionide-VSCode\n\n**GitHub link:** [https://github.com/ionide/Ionide-vscode-fsharp](https://github.com/ionide/Ionide-vscode-fsharp)\n**License:** [MIT](https://github.com/ionide/Ionide-vscode-fsharp/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n\nIonide is a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) package suite for cross platform F# development.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/fsharp.gif\" />\n\n## Overview\n\nIonide for VSCode is set of 3 plugins avaliable in VSCode marketplace.\n\n* [Ionide-fsharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) - provides F# specific features including advanced editor features (autocomplete, go-to definition, tooltips, rename, various refactorings and quick fix suggestions), integration with .NET project system, project explorer for project file visualization and manipulation, integration with MsBuild for building and running applications, debugger integration and more.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/fsi.gif\" />\n\n\n* [Ionide-Paket](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-Paket) - provides integration with Paket - package dependency manager for .NET with support for NuGet packages and GitHub repositories.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/paket.gif\" />\n\n* [Ionide-FAKE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fake) - FAKE (F# Make) is popular F# tool and DSL for build orchestration.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/fake.gif\" />\n\n## List of features\n\n#### F# IDE\n\n* Syntax highlighting\n* Error highlighting\n* Autocomplete\n* Tooltips\n* Quick Info Toolbar\n* Usages highlighting\n* F# Interactive (REPL) panel\n* Go-to declaration\n* Finding symbols in file\n* Go-to any symbol in solution\n* Rename\n* Find usages\n* Peek View declaration\n* CodeLens feature showing type signatures\n* CodeOutline tree view\n* Listing all errors in workspace\n* Building using msbuild / xbuild\n* Integration with .NET\n* Project explorer tree view\n* Debugging\n* Record stub generation\n* Union pattern case generation\n* Integration with F# Interactive\n\n#### F# Project management\n\n* Possibility to create new empty solutions or projects based on .NET SDK Templates\n* Adding, removing, ordering files in project\n* Adding and removing project references\n\n#### Paket integration\n\n* Paket initialization\n* Adding, installing, updating packages from solution or current project (allows the choice of package version)\n* Removing packages from solution or current project\n* Converting from NuGet, simplify dependency graph, turning on auto-restore for solution.\n* Listing outdated packages\n\n#### FAKE integration\n\n* Running any build target defined in FAKE build script\n* Running default FAKE target\n\n#### MSBuild integration\n\n* Build/Clean/Rebuild the current project\n* Build/Clean/Rebuild any project in the current workspace\n\n#### And much more...\n\n"},{"uri":"/Editors/Code/options.html","title":"Customization","content":"\n# Customizing Ionide\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* [How to set an option](#how-to-set-an-option)\n* [Ionide Settings](#ionide-settings)\n* [Theming](#theming)\n\n## How to set an option?\n\nIt is easy to configure Visual Studio Code to your liking through its various settings. Nearly every part of VS Code's editor, user interface, and functional behavior has options you can modify.\n\nVS Code provides two different scopes for settings:\n\n* **User Settings** - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.\n* **Workspace Settings** - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.\n\nWorkspace settings override user settings. Workspace settings are specific to a project and can be shared across developers on a project.\n\n> Note: A VS Code \"workspace\" is usually just your project root folder\n\nTo open your user and workspace settings, use the following VS Code menu command:\n\n* On Windows/Linux - `File > Preferences > Settings`\n* On macOS - `Code > Preferences > Settings`\n\nYou can also open the Settings editor from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) with `Preferences: Open Settings` or use the keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+,`).\n\nRead more about settings in VSCode in [VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)\n\n---\n\n## Ionide Settings\n\n#### `FSharp.fsac.attachDebugger`\n\nAppends the '--attachdebugger' argument to fsac, this will allow you to attach a debugger.\n\n**Type:** `bool`\n\n**Default:** `false`\n\n---\n\n#### `FSharp.fsac.cachedTypeCheckCount`\n\nThe [MemoryCacheOptions.SizeLimit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.memorycacheoptions.sizelimit?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0) for caching typechecks.\n\n**Type:** `integer`\n\n**Default:** `200`\n\n---\n\n\n#### `FSharp.fsac.conserveMemory` (**Deprecated** use `FSharp.fsac.gc.conserveMemory`)\n\nThis will set [DOTNET_GCConserveMemory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/runtime-config/garbage-collector#conserve-memory).

For a deep dive on semantic tokens, including how\nto find out which tokens and modifiers have been applied to source code that you want to theme, please see the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_editor-semantic-highlighting).\n\nIn addition to the standard set of tokens and modifiers shown on that documentation, Ionide provides several custom scopes and modifiers:\n\n#### Scopes\n\n* `member`- used in mutable vars and record fields, as well as exceptions, fields, events, delegates, and named arguments\n* `cexpr` - for computation expressions\n* `text` - for plaintext strings\n\n#### Modifiers\n\n* `mutable` - for any values that are defined as `let mutable`\n* `disposable` - for any values that implement `System.IDisposable`\n\n\n### Applying custom themes\n\nLike all settings, theme customizations are stored in settings files, which are described at the top of this page in greater detail.\n\nSemantic tokens can be overidden on a theme-by-theme basis in the following way:\n\n\n```js\n{\n    \"editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations\": {\n      \"[Default Dark+]\": {\n            \"enabled\": true,\n            \"rules\": {\n                \"*.mutable\": {\n                    \"foreground\": \"#FF0000\",\n                    \"fontStyle\": \"underline\",\n                },\n                \"*.disposable\": {\n                    \"foreground\": \"#ff8b2c\",\n                    \"fontStyle\": \"bold\"\n                }\n\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA few things to note about this example:\n\n* the individual theme names are placed into square brackets\n* the `rules` are a map of `scope` or `modifier` to the theme settings to be applied to tokens that match\n* the key of a `rule` can be\n  * a fully-qualified scope (i.e. `<scope>.<modifier>`, for example `member.mutable`)\n  * just a scope (i.e. `member`)\n  * a wildcard modifier (i.e. `*.mutable` to apply to all mutables, regardless of scope)\n\n\n### Recommended settings for larger solution/projects\n\nHere are settings recommended for larger projects to help with performance.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"FSharp.codeLenses.references.enabled\": false,\n    \"FSharp.enableMSBuildProjectGraph\": true,\n    \"FSharp.enableAdaptiveLspServer\": true,\n    \"FSharp.fsac.gc.conserveMemory\": 9\n}\n```\n\n* `FSharp.codeLenses.references.enabled` - Recommend disabling this because it requires typechecks of your whole solution.\n* `FSharp.enableMSBuildProjectGraph` - Recommend enabling this because it can speed up project load times for larger [project graphs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/static-graph.md#project-graph).\n* `FSharp.enableAdaptiveLspServer` - Recommended enabling this because it has more [stable state management](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Data.Adaptive).\n* `FSharp.fsac.gc.conserveMemory` - Recommended enabling this because it will [tell dotnet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/runtime-config/garbage-collector#conserve-memory) compact [Large Object Heap](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/large-object-heap) allocations.\n"},{"uri":"/Editors/Code/generalInfo.html","title":"General information","content":"\n# General information\n\nIonide is complex tool with many options, and powerful capabilities, supporting multiple scenarios available to F# developers. As such is crucial to learn some general information about Ionide's requirements, and different configuration options that should be used depending on the different runtime and environments that can be used.\n\n### Project files parsing\n\nIonide supports SDK-based project files and solutions only. When you open VSCode in particular workspace, Ionide will try to find all `.sln` files in this workspace, and you will be presented with the option to open particular solution or ignore solution files and load all projects in the solution.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/chooseSolution.png\" />\n\nWhen Ionide detects any F# projects it will display them in the `Solution Explorer`. To access it you need to press F# logo button on the activity bar. In there you will see list of F# projects, their status, list of file and references. You can also right-click on different nodes in the tree to access operations that can be performed by the Ionide, such as `Build Project` or `Add file`.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/projectExplorer.png\" />\n\n> NOTE: In case of the problems with project parsing (Projects in status `loading failed`) you can right-click on the project node and use `Show Project Status` to see more details about the problem. We also recommend using `F#: Clear Cache` action and reloading the window, as first step in debugging any problems.\n\n### FsAutoComplete Service Runtime\n\nThe Ionide plugin relies on the F# compiler services for processing code in the editor. This requires the .NET SDK version 6.0.100 or greater to be installed on your machine.\n\n### MsBuild Host\n\nThe Ionide plugin provides deep integration with MSBuild - starting from project parsing (process of getting list of files, references and properties out of `fsproj` file) through project modifications (adding new files, ordering them, adding project-to-project references) to building and running projects. All features provided by Ionide in area of project management are described more in the [Project](project) section.\n\nIonide uses the cross platform version of MsBuild provided by the installed .NET SDK.\n"},{"uri":"/Editors/Code/building.html","title":"Building your code","content":"\n# Building your code\n\n### Smart build configurations\n\nIonide generates VSCode [Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) for building, cleaning, and re-building every project in your workspace, as well as for the entire solution (if you have one). These tasks can be used as-is, or you can easily use them as the start of your own custom configurations.\n\nTo explicitly run one of the new tasks, first select the `Tasks: Run Task` command from the Command Palette (which can be invoked by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`). \n\n<img class=\"png\" src=\"/static/images/vscode-run-tasks.png\" />\n\nThen, choose the `msbuild` category:\n\n<img class=\"png\" src=\"/static/images/vscode-task-category.png\" />\n\nFinally, choose the task you want to run from the list:\n\n<img class=\"png\" src=\"/static/images/vscode-msbuild-tasks.png\" />\n\n### Defaults\n\nBy default, using `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+B` will run the 'build' task for the current project.\n\n### Integration with debugging\n\nAll generated tasks can be used as `preLaunchTask`s for your own launch/debug configurations, which can really help for ensuring that the most recent build is always used when debugging or running your own code.

Generally this means projects with a `ProjectType` of `Exe`. These autogenerated configurations act essentially the same as running `dotnet run` in the project's directory.\n\nIonide will generate additional launch configurations for any projects that have a [`Properties/launchSettings.json`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments?view=aspnetcore-6.0#development-and-launchsettingsjson) file. This file is often generated by Visual Studio, but can be generated manually as well. These launch settings profiles can be run by Visual Studio, `dotnet run`, `dotnet watch`, and JetBrains Rider, and now VSCode joins the bunch! Any launch settings profiles with a `commandName` of `Project` can be run, and any `applicationUrl`, `environmentVariables`, and `commandLineArgs` settings will be used.\n\nThe generated launch configurations will set a `preLaunchTask` dependency on the `Build` task for their associated project, so you'll always run the most up-to-date build before running your code.\n\n### Running a launch configuration\n\nTo explicitly run one of the new launch configurations, choose the Debug menu, and select a configuration from the drop-down menu. From there, you're all set!"},{"uri":"/Editors/Code/editing.html","title":"Editing evolved","content":"# Editing evolved\n\nIonide provides a variety of language features known from larger IDEs such as VS, and a set of innovative features that makes you more productive then ever when writing F# code like CodeLenses, integration with FSharpLint and Quick Fixes.\n\n## Basic features\n\nFollowing documentation is basic overview of features from Ionide's point of view. If you want to learn more about capabilities of VSCode visit [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics). We strongly recommend exploring detailed VSCode documentation, especially if you've never worked with similar (Atom, ST3) editor before.\n\n### IntelliSense\n\nIf Ionide knows possible completions, the IntelliSense suggestions will pop up as you type. If you continue typing characters, the list of members (variables, methods, etc.) is filtered to include only members containing your typed characters. Pressing `Tab` or `Enter` will insert the selected member.\n\nYou can trigger IntelliSense in any editor window by typing `Ctrl+Space` or by typing a trigger character (such as the dot character (`.`)).\n\n> Tip: The suggestions widget supports CamelCase filtering meaning you can type the letters which are upper cased in a method name to limit the suggestions. For example, \"cra\" will quickly bring up \"createApplication\".\n\nAdditionally, Ionide provides autocompletion for symbols not defined in currently opened modules and namespaces. If you accept such completion with `Tab` or `Enter` it will automatically insert appropriate `open` statement. This behavior is controlled by `FSharp.externalAutocomplete` setting (default value is `true`).\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, you can see quick info for each method by either pressing `Ctrl+Space` or clicking the info icon. The accompanying documentation for the method will now expand to the side. The expanded documentation will stay so and will update as you navigate the list. You can close this by pressing `Ctrl+Space` again or by clicking on the close icon.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/autocomplete.gif\" />\n\n### Tooltips\n\nIonide provides rich information about the symbols you hover on - structured signature and nicely formatted documentation text supporting markdown inside of the comments and transforming standard XML comment tags into markdown representation.\n\n> Tip: If you press `Ctrl` while hovering Ionide will also put the body of the symbol in the tooltip.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/tooltips.gif\" />\n\n\n### Error highlighting\n\nIonide provides fast error highlighting for local changes, changes in current project and cross project changes without any need to build projects. Error highlighting for current projects works as you edit code, it supports files not saved to disk. For cross project error reporting you need to save the file - it will queue background project type checking which will provide errors asynchronously without blocking any editor operations.\n\nErrors in VSCode are shown in multiple places:\n\n* In the status bar, there is a summary of all errors and warnings counts.\n* You can click on the summary or press `Ctrl+Shift+M` to display the `PROBLEMS` panel with a list of all current errors.\n* If you open a file that has errors or warnings, they will be rendered inline with the text and in the overview ruler.\n\n> Tip: To loop through errors or warnings in the current file, you can press `F8` or `Shift+F8` which will show an inline zone detailing the problem and possible code actions (if available).\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/errors.gif\" />\n\n\n### CodeLens and LineLens\n\nIonide displays type signatures of the symbols either as information over the symbol (inserting virtual line) or as inlined information next to symbol. The behavior is customizable with `editor.codeLens`, `FSharp.lineLens.enabled` and `FSharp.lineLens.*` settings.\n\n### Inlay hints\n\nIonide provides Inlay Hints that call out the types of let-bindings, as well as the parameter names of method parameters.\n\n### Quick Info panel\n\nYou can check the type of symbol on which cursor currently is in the left part of VSCode Status Bar (bottom bar with different additional information about current position and file)\n\n### Generate record stubs\n\nYou can generate record stubs by using the `Quick Fix` feature (Default keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+.`). The feature is activated in two ways:\n\n* Using a type hint ```let p : Person = { }``` with the cursor over `Person`\n* Starting to type the fields of the record\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/generateRecordStubs.gif\" />\n\n### Generate pattern matching stubs\n\nYou can generate pattern matching stubs by using the `Quick Fix` feature (Default keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+.`).\n\n### Generate object expression implementation stub\n\nYou can generate object expression implementation stub by using the `Quick Fix` feature (Default keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+.`).\n\n### Smart debug configurations\n\nIonide generates Debugging Launch Configurations for runnable projects in your workspace. These can be extracted at any time to be a good starting point for any customizations you'd like to make. In addition, if your projects support [launchSettings.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments?view=aspnetcore-6.0#development-and-launchsettingsjson), Ionide will generate a launch configuration for each launch profile with `\"commandName\"` of `'Project'` that you have configured.  This allows you to share launch configurations across VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, and the dotnet CLI via the `dotnet run` command.\n\n## Code navigation\n\nVisual Studio Code has a high productivity code editor which, when combined with programming language services, gives you the power of an IDE and the speed of a text editor. In this part we will show different ways of navigating around the code.\n\n### Go to definition\n\nIonide provides going to symbol definition. You can do that by pressing `F12`, pressing right click on symbol and choosing `Go to definition` or by using `Ctrl+Click` or running `Go to definition` from Command Palette.\n\n> Tip: You can use `Ctrl+Alt+Click` or open the definition to the side in additional editor panel.\n\n### Go to type definition\n\nIonide provides going to definition of the type of current symbol if the type was defined in local workspace. You can do that by running the `Go to Type Definition` command from either the editor context menu or the Command Palette.\n\n> Tip: The command `editor.action.goToTypeDefinition` is not bound to a keyboard shortcut by default but you can add your own custom keybinding.\n\n### Go to symbol in file\n\nYou can navigate symbols inside a file with `Ctrl+Shift+O`. Just press `Up` or `Down` and navigate to the place you want.\n\n> Tip: By typing `:` the symbols will be grouped by category.\n\n### Go to symbol in workspace\n\nIonide support jumping to a symbol across files with `Ctrl+T`. Just type the first letter of a symbol you want to navigate to, regardless of which file contains it, and press `Enter`.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/goToSymbol.gif\" />\n\n### Find all references & Peek definition\n\nIonide also implements providers for finding all references (`Shift+F12`) of the symbol in currently open solution and peeking definition of the symbol (`Alt+F12`). VSCode provides peeked editors which enables you to see the source code of the other file inlined without switching context. You can navigate between different references in the peeked editor and make quick edits right there. Clicking on the peeked editor filename or double-clicking in the result list will open the reference in the outer editor.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/peek.gif\" />\n\n### Bracket matching\n\nMatching brackets will be highlighted as soon as the cursor is near one of them.\n\n> Tip: You can jump to the matching bracket with `Ctrl+Shift+\\`\n\n### Go to next symbol usage\n\nUsages of symbol in current file will be highlighted as soon as the cursor is on the symbol.\n\n> Tip: You can jump to the next/previous usage with `F7` and `Shift+F7`\n\n### Go to MSDN help\n\nIonide provides command for opening MSDN documentation for given symbol. It works only for symbols from F# standard library, and .NET standard library. You can execute command with `Shift+F1` or from Command Palette (`F#: Get Help`).\n\n### CodeOutline panel\n\nIonide provides live updated panel showing symbols in current file. It's available as a additional tree view (`F# Code Outline`) in VSCode Explorer panel. On the panel you can notice 2 buttons - right one collapse (`Click`) or extends (`Alt+Click`) all elements in the tree, left one refreshes default collapsing (only modules and namespaces extended, types collapsed).\n\n> Tip: Clicking on any node in the tree will move you to the place in file where symbol is defined. It's really useful for navigating around huge files.\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/codeOutline.gif\" />\n\n## Advanced analyzers\n\n### FSharpLint integration\n\nIonide incorporates the [FSharpLint](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpLint/) project, which allows you to run linting rules against your code and see the results in your editor.\n\n### Unused value analyzer\n\nIonide will detect unused values in your code and suggest that you remove them.\n\n### Unnecessary open statement analyzer\n\nIonide will detect namespaces and modules that you've `open`ed in your code that aren't being used, and suggest that you remove them.\n\n### Simplify name analyzer\n\nIf you've over-qualified a name, for example if you've typed `System.IO.FileInfo` when you already had `System.IO` open, Ionide will suggest a codefix that removes the unnecessary portion of the name.\n\n## Refactoring\n\n### Rename symbol\n\nIonide supports renaming of bindings, parameters, and so on.\n\n### Code Fixes\n\nIonide supports a host of code fixes. They can all be invoked by using the light bulb icon that appears when they are available.\n\n* Add an explicit type to a function parameter\n* Add a `fun` keyword to a lambda that was written without one\n* Add a missing 'self' identifier parameter to a method that needs one\n* Add a missing `rec` keyworkd to a recursive function that doesn't have one\n* Add an explicit type annotation to a parameter that throws an indeterminate type error (errors 72 or 3245)\n* Change C#-style use of `=` for assignment to `<-` instead\n* Change C#-style use of `=>` for a lambda to `->` instead\n* Change uses of `typeof<'t>.Name` to use `nameof('t)` instead\n* Change use of `=` in record field declarations to `:`\n* Change C#-style use of `!=` to `<>` instead\n* Change a record creation of an unknown type to use an anonymous record instead\n* Change a positionally-matched DU to a named-match DU instead\n* Change C#-style use of `==` for equality to `=` instead\n* Change the declaration of a let-binding to `mutable` when a user attempts to mutate it later\n* Add a missing `=` when you start a type declaration and rush past the name to the fields/union cases\n* Convert negation of a value to subtraction instead when negation was not intended\n* Suggest the use of `new` for disposable types\n* Wrap an expression in parentheses when it is necessary to resolve parameter ambiguity\n* Remove redundant qualifiers\n* Change C#-style use of `!` for negation to use `not` instead\n* Remove explicit `return` or `yield` commands inside a CE when the compiler thinks they are not necessary\n* Change use of the `!` operator on ref cells to use `.Value` instead\n* Offer to open modules/namespaces or use fully-qualified names when a type is used but the full name cannot be resolved\n* Replace a potentially-typo'ed identifier name with one from a compiler-suggested list of possibilities\n* Replace the use of unsafe downcast operations with safe casts operations when it is correct to do so\n\n### Generate XML documentation comments\n\nIonide can generate XML documentation comments that scaffold out the relevant XML structures for your current function, member or value."},{"uri":"/Editors/Vim/getting_started.html","title":"Installation","content":"\n# Ionide-vim - Installation\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Neovim or Vim 8.0+ - Python support is not required as of now.

On the client side, it's powered by [autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim)\n\n\n<img class=\"gif\" src=\"/static/images/vim.gif\" />\n\n## List of features\n\n- Syntax highlighting\n- Auto completions\n- Error highlighting, error list, and quick fixes based on errors\n- Tooltips\n- Go to Definition\n- Find all references\n- Highlighting usages\n- Rename\n- Show symbols in file\n- Find symbol in workspace\n- Show signature in status line\n- Integration with F# Interactive **(new!)**\n- Integration with FSharpLint (additional hints and quick fixes) **(new!)**\n\n\n\n"},{"uri":"/Editors/Vim/usage.html","title":"How to use","content":"\n# How to use\n\nOpening either `*.fs`, `*.fsi` or `*.fsx` files should trigger syntax highlighting and other depending runtime files as well.\n\n### Commands\n\nRefer to [LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim) for features provided via Language Server Protocol.\n\nTo be added as requested for F#-specific features.\n\n#### `:FSharpLoadWorkspaceAuto`\n  - Searches a workspace (`sln` or `fsproj`) and then load it.\n  - Equivalent to `FSharp.workspaceMode = sln` in Ionide-VSCode.\n  - Automatically called when you open F# files. Can be disabled in settings.\n  - The deep level of directory hierarchy to search can also be configured in settings.\n\n#### `:FSharpParseProject <files>+`\n  - Loads specified projects (`sln` or `fsproj`).\n\n#### `:FSharpReloadWorkspace`\n  - Reloads all the projects currently loaded.\n  - Automatically called when you save `.fsproj` files. Can be disabled in settings.\n\n#### `:FSharpUpdateServerConfig`\n  - Updates FSAC configuration.\n  - See [FsAutoComplete Settings](#fsautocomplete-settings) for details.\n\n#### `:FSharpUpdateFSAC`\n  - Downloads the latest build of FsAutoComplete to be used with Ionide-vim.\n\n### Working with F# Interactive\n\nIonide-vim has an integration with F# Interactive.\n\nFSI is displayed using the builtin `:terminal` feature introduced in Vim 8 / Neovim and can be used like in VSCode.\n\n#### `:FsiShow`\n  - Shows a F# Interactive window.\n\n#### `:FsiEval <expr>`\n  - Evaluates given expression in FSI.\n\n#### `:FsiEvalBuffer`\n  - Sends the content of current file to FSI.\n\n#### `:FsiReset`\n  - Resets the current FSI session.\n\n#### `Alt-Enter`\n  - When in normal mode, sends the current line to FSI.\n  - When in visual mode, sends the selection to FSI.\n  - Sending code to FSI opens FSI window but the cursor does not focus to it. Unlike Neovim, Vim doesn't support asynchronous buffer updating so you have to input something (e.g. moving cursor) to see the result. You can change this behavior in settings.\n\n#### `Alt-@`\n  - Toggles FSI window. FSI windows shown in different tabpages share the same FSI session.\n  - When opened, the cursor automatically focuses to the FSI window (unlike in `Alt-Enter` by default).\n\nYou can customize the location of FSI, key mappings, etc. See [the documentation below](#f-interactive-settings).\n\n### Settings\n\nRefer to [LanguageClient-neovim's recommended settings](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim/wiki/Recommended-Settings#recommended-settings)\nfor features provided via Language Server Protocol.\n\nTo be added as requested for F#-specific features.\n\n#### FsAutoComplete Settings\n\n* Ionide-vim uses `snake_case` for the setting names.\n  - For FSAC settings only, `CamelCase` can also be used (as it gets serialized to a F# record).\n  - If both `snake_case` and `CamelCase` are specified, the `snake_case` one will be preferred.\n* You can change the values at runtime and then notify the changes to FSAC by `:FSharpUpdateServerConfig`.\n* Some of the settings may not work in Ionide-vim as it is lacking the corresponding feature of Ionide-VSCode.\n* If not specified, the recommended default values described on the FSAC's documentation will be used.\n  - If you are using a JSON configuration file though `g:LanguageClient_settingsPath`, the recommended default values will override the settings loaded from it.\n  - You can disable this by `let g:fsharp#use_recommended_server_config = 0`.\n\nSee [the documentation of FSAC](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete#settings)\nfor the complete list of available settings. Frequently used ones are:\n\n##### Enable/disable automatic calling of `:FSharpLoadWorkspaceAuto` on opening F# files (default: enabled)\n\n~~~.vim\nlet g:fsharp#automatic_workspace_init = 1 \" 0 to disable.\n~~~\n\n##### Set the deep level of directory hierarchy when searching for sln/fsprojs (default: `2`)\n\n~~~.vim\nlet g:fsharp#workspace_mode_peek_deep_level = 2\n~~~\n\n##### Ignore specific directories when loading a workspace (default: empty)\n\n~~~.vim\nlet g:fsharp#exclude_project_directories = ['paket-files']\n~~~\n\n##### Enable/disable linter and unused opens/declarations analyzer (default: all enabled)\n\nYou may want to bind `LanguageClient#textDocument_codeAction()` to some shortcut key. Refer to their docs.\n\n~~~.vim\n\" 0 to disable.\nlet g:fsharp#linter = 1\nlet g:fsharp#unused_opens_analyzer = 1\nlet g:fsharp#unused_declarations_analyzer = 1\n~~~\n\n#### Editor Settings\n\n##### Enable/disable automatic calling of `:FSharpReloadWorkspace` on saving `fsproj` (default: enabled)\n\n~~~.vim\nlet g:fsharp#automatic_reload_workspace = 1 \" 0 to disable.\n~~~\n\n##### Show type signature at cursor position (default: enabled)\n\n~~~.vim\nlet g:fsharp#show_signature_on_cursor_move = 1 \" 0 to disable.\n~~~\n\n#### F# Interactive Settings\n\n##### Change the F# Interactive command to be used within Ionide-vim (default: `dotnet fsi`)\n\nIf you want to use a .NET Framework FSI instead of .NET Core one, set `g:fsharp#use_sdk_scripts` to `0`.\nSee: https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete/pull/466#issue-324869672\n\n~~~.vim\nlet g:fsharp#fsi_command = \"fsharpi\"\nlet g:fsharp#use_sdk_scripts = 0 \" for net462 FSI\n~~~\n\n##### Set additional runtime arguments passed to FSI (default: `[]` (empty))\n\nSets additional arguments of the FSI instance Ionide-vim spawns and changes the behavior of FSAC accordingly when editing fsx files.\n\n~~~.vim\nlet g:fsharp#fsi_extra_parameters = ['--langversion:preview']\n~~~\n\n##### Customize how FSI window is opened (default: `botright 10new`)\n\nIt must create a new empty window and then focus to it.\n\nSee [`:help opening-window`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/windows.html#opening-window) for details.\n\n~~~.vim\nlet g:fsharp#fsi_window_command = \"botright vnew\"\n~~~\n\n##### Set if sending line/selection to FSI shoule make the cursor focus to FSI window (default: disabled)\n\nIf you are using Vim, you might want to enable this to see the result without inputting something.\n\n~~~.vim\nlet g:fsharp#fsi_focus_on_send = 1 \" 0 to not to focus.\n~~~\n\n##### Change the key mappings (default: `vscode`)\n\n* `vscode`:     Default. Same as in Ionide-VSCode (`Alt-Enter` to send, `Alt-@` to toggle terminal).\n  - `<M-CR>` in Neovim / `<ESC><CR>` in Vim: Sends line/selection to FSI.\n  - `<M-@>`  in Neovim / `<ESC>@`    in Vim: Toggles FSI window.\n* `vim-fsharp`: Same as in [fsharp/vim-fsharp](https://github.com/fsharp/vim-fsharp#fsharp-interactive). Note that `<leader>` is mapped to backslash by default. See [`:help mapleader`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/map.html#mapleader).\n  - `<leader>i` : Sends line/selecion to FSI.\n  - `<leader>e` : Toggles FSI window.\n* `custom`:     You must set both `g:fsharp#fsi_keymap_send` and `g:fsharp#fsi_keymap_toggle` by yourself.\n  - `g:fsharp#fsi_keymap_send`   : Sends line/selection to FSI.\n  - `g:fsharp#fsi_keymap_toggle` : Toggles FSI window.\n* `none`:       Disables mapping.\n\n~~~.vim\n\" custom mapping example\nlet g:fsharp#fsi_keymap = \"custom\"\nlet g:fsharp#fsi_keymap_send   = \"<C-e>\"\nlet g:fsharp#fsi_keymap_toggle = \"<C-@>\"\n~~~\n\n### Advanced Tips\n\n#### Show tooltips on CursorHold\n\nIf you are using neovim 0.4.0 or later, floating windows will be used for tooltips and you might find it convenient to make them appear if the cursor does not move for several seconds.\n\n~~~.vim\nif has('nvim') && exists('*nvim_open_win')\n  augroup FSharpShowTooltip\n    autocmd!\n    autocmd CursorHold *.fs,*.fsi,*.fsx call fsharp#showTooltip()\n  augroup END\nendif\n~~~\n\nNote that you can set the delay time to show the tooltip by [`set updatetime=<ms>`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'updatetime'). The default delay is 4 seconds, which you may find too slow."}]
